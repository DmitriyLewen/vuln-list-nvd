      "value": "`bhyveload -h \u003chost-path\u003e` may be used to grant loader access to the \u003chost-path\u003e directory tree on the host.  Affected versions of bhyveload(8) do not make any attempt to restrict loader's access to \u003chost-path\u003e, allowing the loader to read any file the host user has access to.Â In the bhyveload(8) model, the host supplies a userboot.so to boot with, but the loader scripts generally come from the guest image.  A maliciously crafted script could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from the host accessible to the user running bhyhveload(8), which is often the system root."
